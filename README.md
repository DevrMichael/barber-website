## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), ensuring a solid foundation for React development with optimized configurations.

### Available Scripts

Within the project directory, the following commands are available:

- **`npm start`**: Initiates the app in development mode. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you'll see lint errors in the console.

- **`npm test`**: Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details, refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation.

- **`npm run build`**: Compiles the app for production into the `build` folder, optimizing performance for deployment with minification and hashed filenames.

- **`npm run eject`**: Offers an option to customize build tools and configurations. **Note**: This is irreversible.
